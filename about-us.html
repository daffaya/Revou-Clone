            <h1>RevoU Culture</h1>
            <div class="paragraph-wrapper">
              <p>
                When thinking about our distinctive Culture and how we operate
                as an Organization, we asked ourselves two fundamental
                questions:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. What is uniquely particular about RevoU?
                <br />
                2. What is it that our employees experience here, that they
                won't experience elsewhere?
              </p>
              <p>
                In answering such questions, we first came up with a list of
                industry standard values. Values that, despite being an integral
                part of our culture, we share with many other employers in the
                job market. Especially the ones we compete with to attract the
                very best talent, that is other tech start ups.
              </p>
              <p>These are values such as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Collaboration &amp teamwork</li>
                <li>Integrity</li>
                <li>Customer centricity</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                For as much as we shouldn't take these for granted, we believe
                that these are not what make us truly unique. Not what we fully
                aspire to. Not the ones to keep ourselves accountable in our
                day-to-day life at RevoU to pursue our vision to make RevoU the
                most inspiring and career defining place to work in Southeast
                Asia.
              </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold">
                So, what are the distinctive values that makes us uniquely
                RevoU?

              We always try to put ourselves in other people's shoes. Be it our
              team member, our direct report or our manager.
            </p>
            <p>
              We act with compassion and think about the consequences of our
              behavior on the other person, regardless of the hierarchical
              relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are empathetic with our colleagues but also, and especially
              with our most important stakeholder: our students.
            </p>
            <p>
              We understand how much anxiety comes with starting or changing a
              career and in particular in looking for a new job. Whenever take
              this for granted, and try to support our students as much as we
              cannot only in equipping them with the most effective technical
              skills but in providing them all the psychological support they
              need.

          <!-- <div class="paragraph-menu" id="paragraph-menu-2">
            <p>
              We treat people with the same respect regardless of their
              seniority and role in the company. We are as kind with our older
              teammates as we are with the new intern who just started last
              Monday.
            </p>
            <p>
              We respect each and every one of our students as if our overall
              business depended on that very one student. No matter how many
              thousands and millions of professional lives we are able to touch,
              we never forget that behind such aggregate numbers are unique
              people and life stories..

          <div class="paragraph-menu" id="paragraph-menu-3">
            <p>
              Despite being extremely driven and ambitious about our own career,
              we are leaving your ego at RevoU's entrance door.
            </p>
            <p>
              We make time to help our colleagues, even if it doesn't directly
              benefit us (or our team). We are lifting everyone around us as we
              genuinely want them to succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that career progression at RevoU is not a zero-sum
              game: helping each other will benefit everyone's career.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are aware that our drive and selflessness put us at risk of
              forgetting about our own well-being and we are not afraid to take
              a step back when necessary, balancing the intensity of our
              day-to-day work with periods of deserved rest.
